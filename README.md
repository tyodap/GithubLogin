# GithubLogin

Hi this is my repository about my simple login and logout to Github. Here's the prerequisite.
1. Make sure you have JDK on your local machine
2. I run it with Eclipse IDE
3. Make sure the chromedriver is same with your chrome if not just replace my chromedriver
4. On code to sendkeys Username and Field put your Github credential and run it as JUnit Test
